# KISS-kde

This is currently a work in progress. Feel free to help out!

I have no interest in using KDE; I just want to see if it can be done on KISS. I plan on maintaining this __indefinitely__, but low use might lead to my missing multiple bugs. Please feel free to submit a pull request or make an issue to fix anything you find. 


**Again, this is __not__ ready for use. By any stretch of the imagination.**
