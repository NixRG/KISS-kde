# KISS-kde

This is currently a work in progress. Feel free to help out!

I have no interest in using KDE; I just want to see if it can be done on KISS. I plan on maintaining this __indefinitely__, but low use might lead to my missing multiple bugs. Please feel free to submit a pull request or make an issue to fix anything you find. 


There are many, __many__ packages for a Plasma Desktop (because I guess fragmentation is cool?). Ostensibly, anybody who wants a KDE environment wants a KDE environment, so I don't plan on nixing features or removing any packages. As a result, when this has been tested as being 'buildable' and 'runable', I will then create a meta-package that simply requires all of these as dependencies. THAT is the package which should be installed. To reiterate: you should install (pkg name forthcoming), NOT these packages individually. 



**Again, this is __not__ ready for use. By any stretch of the imagination.**
